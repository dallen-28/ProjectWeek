# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. --> 
This project aims to add the WitMotion JY901 Accelerometer Device to PlusLib.

## Objective
1. Decode orientation data being received from WitMotion accelerometer and add as a new Device to PlusLib.

## Approach and Plan

1. Use existing MicrochipTracker device as a template.
2. Ensure orientation data is being decoded correctly.
3. Create/Update rotation matrix 
4. Ensure rotation matrix is being updated correctly in Slicer
